# DigiDrop - Phaser3

> A free, web-based game project created with Phaser3 engine.

## Game Description:
Objects fall around the player character under a time limit. The player must drag the character sideways to catch the falling coins and clocks or dodge bombs. The number of coins equals player score. The bombs deduct a certain number from the score if the player catches one. The clock adds additional 5 seconds to the the countdown timer.

## Project Background:
This project was created as an alternative proof-of-concept to **DigiDrop-Unity** which presented the additional APK file size issue. With **DigiDrop-Phaser3**, the concept of just hosting the game in a webpage and viewing it on phones via WebViews is introduced. This way, the additional file size issue is averted while keeping the the speedy and smooth gameplay through Phaser3 engine.

Unlike DigiDrop-Unity, this game project doesn't utilize the device's camera, gyroscope nor accelerometer. The player character is draggable horizontally to allow side movement.

## Assets:
- The art for the coins, clocks and the bombs were downloaded as free assets from itch.io
- The player character and the basket were art assets created by my ex-colleague Marc Aguila.
- All SFX's were downloaded from freesound.org
